Sometimes it doesn't say exactly what the\nproblem is, in that case you can use the browser to \"inspect element\" and then\nthere will be some CSS pseudo element applied to the element that contains a\ndescription.\n\nIf you want to develop without `a11y.css` you can run `npm run dev-no-a11y.css`\n\nIn production builds parcel will be able to exclude this entire file from the\nfinal result\n\nWhether or not to add `a11y.css` depends on 2 environment variables:\n1) NODE_ENV: This one is set automatically by parcel, defaults to \"development\"\n  except for production builds.\n2) A11Y_CSS: If this is set to NO then `a11y.css` isn't included, even in\n   development builds\nRead more about parcel and environment variables here:\n  https://parceljs.org/features/node-emulation/#environment-variables\n */\n\n// @ts-ignore\nimport a11yCss from \"bundle-text:./a11y.css\"\n\n// @ts-ignore\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === \"development\" && process.env.A11Y_CSS !== \"NO\") {\n  document.head.insertAdjacentHTML(\"beforeend\", `<style>\\n${a11yCss}\\n</style>` );\n}\n","module.exports = \"bcff64a9f823cf96\";"],"names":[],"version":3,"file":"form.51e44663.js.map"}
