                <p>When we ticket strike we travel with discounted tickets, that cost 650 kr instead of 1060 kr. The purpose of the strike fund is to protect us from the fines that SL might give us. At the same time, we save several hundred kronor by buying discounted tickets.</p>
                <p>If you receive a fine during the strike in January, <a href=/en/form>report it</a> to us and we will pay it from the strike fund.</p>
                <p>The strike fund is run by <a href=/en/#contact>Allt åt alla Stockholm</a>. We don’t save anything other than your name and phone number. Read more about how we protect your personal data <a href=/en/gdpr>here</a>.</p>

            </header>
            <div id=why-content-box>
                <h2 style=text-align:center>A cheaper SL card is needed</h2>
                <p>The SL card is too expensive. It has been for far too long. The price of the SL card has increased more than the price of petrol, more than our salaries and more than the general price trend in society. At the same time, we are struggling to make ends meet with high food prices, rents and interest rates.</p>
                <p>Despite this, the politicians might make it <i>even more expensive</i> next year. Then we will have even less to live on. But we can’t simply opt out of public transit when it becomes more expensive. We need SL to get to work and make our daily lives work.</p>
                <h2 style=text-align:center>A cheaper SL card is possible</h2>
                <p>We know that cheaper tickets are possible:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In Gothenburg, the price of a monthly ticket will be lowered to 720 kr at the turn of the year.</li>
                    <li>In Germany, a monthly ticket for the whole country costs 640 kr.</li>
                    <li>In Vienna, a monthly ticket costs 340 kr.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 style=text-align:center>The&nbsp;politicians&nbsp;don't<br> prioritize&nbsp;our&nbsp;needs</h2>
                <p>Although cheaper tickets are both necessary and possible, Stockholm’s politicians have never lowered the price.</p>
                <p><b>In order for the politicians to lower the price, we have to force them to do so.</b></p>
                <p><b>Our ticket purchases finance half of SL.</b></p>
                <p><b>That gives us power!</b></p>
                <p>At work, we can strike for better salaries and conditions by collectively refusing to work. It works because it hits the employer’s wallet.</p>
                <p>As transit riders, we can similarly strike for cheaper tickets by collectively refusing to pay full price. if we buy discounted tickets we can travel as usual while hitting the politicians budget. This will force the politicians to stop raising prices and cutting down on transit services.</p>
                <h2 style=text-align:center>Together we can win!</h2>
                <p>For the ticket strike to work, we need to be many and we need to help each other. Together we can avoid SL’s ticket inspectors, protect each other from fines and put pressure on the politicians. We need everyone’s help – those of you who can no longer afford an SL card, those of you who can afford it and can pay a little extra into the strike fund, and those of you who are mostly angry that politicians are not prioritizing public transit.</p>

            </header>
            <div id=faq-content-box>
                <h3>When is the ticket strike?</h3>
                <p>In January 2026. Those of us who have 30-day tickets renew them sometime in January. The strike fund is valid until February 28. Those of us who travel with single tickets travel at a discounted price from January 1 to 31.</p>
                <h3>Is it illegal to go on a ticket strike?</h3>
                <p>
                    No! It is not illegal to travel with the wrong ticket or to travel without a ticket. SL only has the right to charge a surcharge. This is regulated by the <a href=https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-197767-om-tillaggsavgift-i-kollektiv_sfs-1977-67/ target=_blank>law on surcharges in public transit.</a>
                </p>
                <h3>What is a discounted ticket and how do I buy one?</h3>
                <p>Most types of tickets (single ticket, 30-day ticket, annual ticket, etc.) have a regular price and a discounted price. The discount applies to everyone under 20, everyone over 65, and students. Anyone can purchase a discounted ticket in the SL app or from an SL retailer (such as Pressbyrån) without proving that they meet the requirements for discounted travel.</p>
                <h3>How do we deal with SL ticket inspectors?</h3>
                <p>If you see a ticket inspector, there are several things you can do. You can help your fellow passengers by alerting them that ticket inspectors are on board. To avoid getting a fine, you can get off the train and wait for the next one. If you are checked, you can delay the ticket inspectors by showing your ticket slowly so that others have time to get off.</p>
                <h3>What are my rights during ticket inspections?</h3>
                <p>Ticket inspectors are not allowed to detain, arrest, or hold passengers. However, they have the right to demand that you get off the train and leave the station. If you do not get off and stand outside the barriers, the inspectors have the right to call security guards to remove you.</p>
                <h3>How do I get my fine paid?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you receive a fine during the strike and are a member of the strike fund, we will pay it!</li>
                    <li>You just need to have been a member for at least one day before you receive your fine.</li>
                    <li>Go to <a href=/en/form>Report fine</a>, fill in your details, attach a (clear!) picture of your fine, and send it. After you pay a deductible of 100 kr, we will pay the fine for you!</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Why not planka</h3>
                <p>We encourage a ticket strike by traveling with discounted tickets simply because it is easier than traveling without a ticket. This allows as many people as possible to participate. However, the strike fund applies regardless of whether you travel without a ticket or with a discounted ticket. It is therefore possible to participate in the ticket strike by plankning (fare dodging).</p>
                <h3>Can I participate in the ticket strike if I am under 20, over 65, or a student?</h3>
                <p>Yes, you can participate in the ticket strike by traveling without a ticket. Read more about this in the previous question. If you do not want to participate by traveling without a ticket, there are other ways to support the ticket strike, see the next question.</p>
                <h3>Can I support the ticket strike without traveling with a discounted ticket?</h3>
                <p>Yes! There are several things you can do. You can sign the <a href=https://www.mittskifte.org/petitions/biljettstrejka-for-billigare-sl-kort target=_blank>petition</a> for the campaign on Mitt Skifte, donate money to the strike fund, and help spread information about the strike on social media and to people you know. During the strike itself, you can help those who are striking by alerting others when ticket inspectors are around and being very slow when you get your ticket checked.</p>
                <h3>Shouldn't public transit be free?</h3>
                <p>Yes, we think so too. Biljettstrejk 2026 is demanding cheaper SL cards because we believe this is something almost everyone can support. At the same time, we believe it is a necessary first step towards completely fare free public transit that is accessible to everyone.</p>
